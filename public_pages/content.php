              <p>President Trump on Wednesday had a testy exchange with the head of NATO when he asked about energy agreements between Russia and several European countries.

              Trump repeatedly pressed Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's secretary general, on why the U.S. continued to pay money to the military alliance while countries continue to purchase energy from Moscow.</p>

              <p>We challenged Matt Le Tissier to provide a five-point plan for how England can beat Croatia and reach the World Cup final.Gareth Southgate leads England into a semi-final for the first time since 1990, knowing Croatia are likely to provide a much sterner test than quarter-final opponents Sweden.England will also be keen to avoid further penalty drama as they face a side who have won both of their knockout matches, against Denmark and then hosts Russia, via shootouts. So, how can they get the job done?</p>

              <p>Australia will sweat on results of further scans on Shaun Marsh's shoulder after Glamorgan confirmed the Test batsman will fly home from his playing stint in the United Kingdom.

              On the eve of his 35th birthday, Marsh injured his left shoulder after diving to stop a boundary in Glamorgan's T20 clash with Sussex at Cardiff on Monday. 

              Scans have revealed he suffered ligament damage and disruption in his acromioclavicular (AC) joint, with the left-hander to miss the remainder of the Welsh county's domestic T20 campaign.</p>
